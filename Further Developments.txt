Future Developments: 
1) Depicting a universal feature, such as epsilon or delta which we could multiply with 2d 
data to get the 3d data. For example, ∈* = ∈/𝜀 (where ∈ = Temperature difference 
between 3d and 2d fins along some particular x and y coordinate and 𝜀 = Difference in z 
planes and ∈* is the term to be multiplied with 2d temperature data along with different x, 
y coordinates to get the required 3d plane temperature data).

2) Developing more robust ML model and physically testing them in real world like 
XGBoost Classifier or Support Vector Regression according to the given dataset.

3) Reducing the time and monetory cost of the approach by getting one simple model to get 
the more accurate result without heavy and expensive resources.

4) Measure a relative error with respect to some variable that was being used there since if 
we go further away from mid-plane the error keeps getting increasing, so it’s better to 
measure it in some terms of error quality.
